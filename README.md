# Pytest description

Add a description of the test scenario in *reStructuredText*. Also
autodoc extension added.

## Thanks

Based on the two examples from the
[sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/development/tutorials/index.html) documentation:
+ recipies
+ intenum

## Gramma

Currently, there is only one directive (**test:test**) with few roles
- reqs (TODO: change from option)
- suite (TODO: read from mark)
- init
- passcrit
- step(s)
- desc

## Examples

1. Standalone (the `example/standalone/my_tests.rst` reStructuredText)
1. Docstring (embedded in the python script as a docstring of the
	`test_` functions)
